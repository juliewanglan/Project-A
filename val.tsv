309	0	a	How stupid is that?
101	0	a	Couldn't figure it out
619	1	a	Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk, got a call, and carried the conversation without a hitch.
2228	1	a	The food came out at a good pace.
1983	0	a	I was mortified.
256	0	a	I'm trying to return it for a refund.
2051	1	a	One of the few places in Phoenix that I would definately go back to again .
2366	1	a	Great food for the price, which is very high quality and house made.
1100	0	a	The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  
855	0	a	Avoid this film at all costs.  
443	1	a	Other than that, the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.
486	1	a	It has been a winner for us.
1228	1	a	Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  
2187	1	a	The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!
1869	0	a	Mediocre food.
1348	1	a	Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  
1304	1	a	The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  
691	1	a	Just what I wanted.
2338	1	a	The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.
451	1	a	Setup went very smoothly.
325	0	a	Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.
555	1	a	Love it.. Great armband.
538	1	a	.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.
981	0	a	Then the film just dropped the ball.
