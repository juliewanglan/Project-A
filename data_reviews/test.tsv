0	It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.
1	Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.
2	The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.
3	This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.
4	If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.
5	Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.
6	What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...
7	The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.
8	I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!
9	The picture resolution is far below what other comparably-priced phones are offering today.
10	AFTER ARGUING WITH VERIZON REGARDING THE DROPPED CALLS WE RETURNED THE PHONES AFTER TWO DAYS.
11	My experience was terrible..... This was my fourth bluetooth headset, and while it was much more comfortable than my last Jabra (which I HATED!!!
12	Poor Talk Time Performance.
13	I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.
14	Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.
15	I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.
16	the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.
17	Disappointed with battery.
18	Needless to say, I wasted my money.
19	It also had a new problem.
20	When it opens, the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off.
21	Not as good as I had hoped.
22	Yet Plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design.
23	Doesn't do the job.
24	I bought two of them and neither will charge.
25	The speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap.
26	Its reception is very very poor.
27	It's AGGRAVATING!
28	Don't buy this product.
29	You never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not.
30	Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support.
31	I Was Hoping for More.
32	The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.
33	All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.
34	"It felt too light and ""tinny.""."
35	None of it works, just don't buy it.
36	This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.
37	Does not fit.
38	Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.
39	none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.
40	Poor Reliability.
41	Don't buy this product - It fails!.
42	I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.
43	I wasted my little money with this earpiece.
44	The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.
45	They do not care about the consumer one bit.
46	I could not recommend these more.
47	This was utterly confusing at first, which caused me to lose a couple of very, very important contacts.
48	This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.
49	Don't buy this product.
50	what a disappointment
51	What a waste.
52	This item worked great, but it broke after 6 months of use.
53	Its not user friendly.
54	That company is a joke.
55	Returned 8 hours later.
56	Poor sound quality.
57	Please dont waste your money.
58	It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.
59	I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.
60	So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.
61	I'll be drivng along, and my headset starts ringing for no reason.
62	A Disappointment.
63	Battery is terrible.
64	I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.
65	Worst Customer Service Ever.
66	Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.
67	Not a good bargain.
68	Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.
69	1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.
70	Would not reccommend.
71	Freezes frequently4.
72	This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.
73	This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.
74	Never got it!!!!!
75	A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.
76	I am sorry I made this purchase.
77	Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!
78	I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.
79	Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.
80	Stay Away From the Q!.
81	Finally, after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.
82	I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment, where with other phones I have not had this problem.
83	During several different 2 minute calls, I experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars.
84	The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.
85	Thank you for wasting my money.
86	This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.
87	Does Not Work.
88	Very much disappointed with this company.
89	DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.
90	AMAZON SUCKS.
91	If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!
92	however, my girl was complain that some time the phone doesn't wake up like normal phone does.
93	its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.
94	Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!
95	Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.
96	I'd like to return it.
97	As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak.
98	This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.
99	Was not happy.
100	Nice case, feels good in your hands.
101	All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.
102	W810i is just SUPERB.
103	I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!
104	Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.
105	The sound quality is excellent as well.
106	"Looks great and is strong."""
107	Great bluetooth!.
108	No shifting, no bubbling, no peeling, not even a scratch, NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.
109	I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.
110	It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.
111	The delivery was on time.
112	I love this device.
113	The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.
114	(It works!)
115	Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.
116	It's pretty easy.
117	Great choice!
118	If you are Razr owner...you must have this!

127	Fantastic earphones.
128	New Battery works great in phone.
129	Battery is holding up well.
130	The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.
131	I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.
132	The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.
133	Good value, works fine - power via USB, car, or wall outlet.
134	I know that sounds funny, but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldn't work well.Well, this one works great.
135	Does everything it should and more.
136	It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.
137	Great for using with your home stereo.
138	Perfect for the PS3.
139	This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.
140	This device is great in several situations:1.)
141	A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.
142	Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.
143	It was a great phone.
144	I am more than happy with this product.
145	Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is
146	I've had no trouble accessing the Internet, downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.
147	It fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal.
148	Nice headphones for the price and they work great!
149	I highly recommend this device to everyone!
150	It has a great camera thats 2MP, and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality.
151	Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.
152	I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.
153	I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.
154	I am glad I purchased it.
155	Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.
156	Good show, Samsung.
157	Nice docking station for home or work.
158	The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.
159	It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!
160	All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.
161	Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.
162	Easy to use.
163	I've had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me.
164	Headset works great & was packaged nicely to avoid any damage.
165	This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.
166	Nice design and quality.
167	I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.
168	The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).
169	I've only had my bluetooth for a few weeks, but I really like it.
170	This fixes all the problems.
171	Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.
172	This PDA rocks.
173	It was quite comfortable in the ear.
174	But despite these few flaws, this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.
175	I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.
176	It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.
177	SWEETEST PHONE!!!
178	I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.
179	im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.
180	Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!
181	They do not last forever, but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.
182	Provides good protection and looks classy, too.
183	This is a great deal.
184	My sister has one also and she loves it.
185	The iGo chargers and tips are really great.
186	Excellent product.
187	I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.
188	I've tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this Jabra one is the first one I've found that fits my ear comfortably.
189	Beautiful styling though.
190	Great charger.
191	It is very comfortable on the ear.
192	This is the phone to get for 2005.... I just bought my S710a and all I can say is WOW!
193	This phone works great.
194	Best of all is the rotating feature, very helpful.
195	This is a good battery, and it got here really fast.
196	I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.
197	I have had mine for about a year and this Christmas I bought some for the rest of the family.
198	But it does get better reception and clarity than any phone I've had before.
199	I am also very happy with the price.
200	The story line is just awful!  
201	I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  
202	I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  
203	This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  
204	Avoid, avoid, avoid!  
205	The result is a film that just don't look right.  
206	Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  
207	Bad characters, bad story and bad acting.  
208	The problem was the script.  
209	To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  
210	There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  
211	If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  
212	Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  
213	What this film lacks is a convincing script.  
214	The film is way too long.  
215	The acting is beyond abysmal.  
216	Not even good for camp value!  
217	Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  
218	This movie totally grates on my nerves.  
219	It's too bad that everyone else involved didn't share Crowe's level of dedication to quality, for if they did, we'd have a far better film on our hands than this sub-par mess.  
220	The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  
221	Really awful.  
222	This short film certainly pulls no punches.  
223	Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  
224	I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  
225	However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  
226	I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  
227	One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  
228	Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  
229	And it was boring.  
230	This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  
231	Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  
232	The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  
233	The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  
234	The movie is terribly boring in places.  
235	Awful.  
236	The acting was bad.  
237	This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  
238	Everything is appalling.  
239	Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  
240	One of the worst shows of all time.  
241	Well... Just if you keep thinking how bad it is.  
242	"Just whatever you do, avoid ""Groove"" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  "
243	The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  
244	The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  
245	I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  
246	God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  
247	However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  
248	Avoid at all costs.  
249	One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  
250	You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  
251	I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  
252	But I recommend waiting for their future efforts, let this one go.  
253	No plot whatsoever!  
254	"I saw ""Mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  "
255	And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  
256	but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes.  
257	A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  
258	This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  
259	This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  
260	The kids are annoying.  
261	The acting sucked.  
262	I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  
263	However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  
264	The worst one of the series.  
265	Even worse than Ticker!  
266	In short, don't bother with this movie.  
267	I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  
268	For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  
269	Beware: this is not a trashy cult movie, this is trash -period!  
270	Yes, it's that bad.  
271	No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  
272	This film has no redeeming features.  
273	there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  
274	), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  
275	It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  
276	The lines, the cuts, the audio, everything is wrong.  
277	And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  
278	I came out of it feeling angry.  
279	The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  
280	The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  
281	It's just lame.  
282	"The scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  "
283	The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  
284	The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  
285	Then, there's the plot holes.  
286	It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  
287	The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  
288	Either way, it sucks.  
289	Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  
290	Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  
291	Generally; it just lacked imagination.  
292	And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  
293	I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  
294	This gets a 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower.  
295	Do not waste your time.  
296	He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?  
297	It's just painful!  
298	"It isn't even an achievement as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" or ""so-bad-it's-memorable"" movie.  "
299	The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  
300	The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  
301	Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  
302	If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  
303	It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  
304	The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  
305	Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  
306	Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  
307	BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  
308	Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  
309	I won't say any more - I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this film is worth your time.  
310	It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  
311	Ray Charles is legendary.  
312	I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  
313	Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  
314	I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  
315	"The best part about ""Nurse Betty"" is it's unpredictability.  "
316	It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  
317	It deserves strong love.  
318	The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  
319	I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  
320	"""You'll love it!  "
321	I just cant explain this movie more than romantic,charming,hilarious,and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny,all the junkyard dogs have something special.Too funny i laughed,kids will LOVE it.Buy it when it comes out,it has new features!  
322	I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  
323	Highly entertaining at all angles.  
324	That was funny.  
325	The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  
326	add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast - everyone played their parts really well.  
327	Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  
328	I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  
329	This is a stunning movie.  
330	This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  
331	I was deeply impressed with the character he played.  
332	She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  
333	When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  
334	Overall, a delight!  
335	Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  
336	This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  
337	It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  
338	Go watch it!  
339	The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  
340	So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  
341	Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  
342	One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  
343	I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  
344	This is just a great movie.  
345	Highly recommended A+  
346	But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  
347	I liked it.  
348	It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  
349	The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  
350	John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screen..James Wong Howe.  
351	I keep watching it over and over.  
352	Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  
353	VERY funny!  
354	I loved it, it was really scary.  
355	If you want a real scare rent this one!  
356	This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  
357	Both Rickman and Stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens' book writer who-- maybe?-- has written a subversive tract.  
358	the cast was great.  
359	This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  
360	Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  
361	Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  
362	The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  
363	Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  
364	It Was So Cool.  
365	The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  
366	Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  
367	This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  
368	Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  
369	Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  
370	The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  
371	It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  
372	Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  
373	The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  
374	See it.  
375	10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  
376	Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  
377	It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  
378	You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  
379	I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  
380	Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  
381	The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  
382	I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  
383	"An Italian reviewer called this ""a small, great film,"" and that's right.  "
384	his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  
385	The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  
386	It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  
387	A standout scene.  
388	But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  
389	It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  
390	All of the main players are mesmerising.  
391	My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  
392	Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  
393	However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  
394	"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  "
395	Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  
396	MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  
397	She carries the movie well.  
398	Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  
399	His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  
400	Worst Thai ever.
401	I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.
402	If the food isn't bad enough for you, then enjoy dealing with the world's worst/annoying drunk people.
403	I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.
404	The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.
405	This greedy corporation will NEVER see another dime from me!
406	The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.
407	No, I'm going to eat the potato that I found some strangers hair in it.
408	If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.
409	This was like the final blow!
410	Same evening, him and I are both drastically sick.
411	But the service was beyond bad.
412	It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.
413	Things that went wrong: - They burned the saganaki.
414	When my mom and I got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad.
415	After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.
416	What a mistake.
417	Food quality has been horrible.
418	I got food poisoning here at the buffet.
419	But I don't like it.
420	The only downside is the service.
421	The one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading.
422	What a mistake that was!
423	No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.
424	The food wasn't good.
425	Needless to say, we will never be back here again.
426	I seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
427	Left very frustrated.
428	I dont think I will be back for a very long time.
429	What SHOULD have been a hilarious, yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us.
430	It's NOT hard to make a decent hamburger.
431	I won't be back.
432	"the food is not tasty at all, not to say its ""real traditional Hunan style""."
433	Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.
434	And then tragedy struck.
435	I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!
436	Everything was gross.
437	I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
438	The service was extremely slow.
439	Food was really boring.
440	Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.
441	And it was way to expensive.
442	Went for lunch - service was slow.
443	Waitress was a little slow in service.
444	The manager was the worst.
445	Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.
446	I've had better atmosphere.
447	I've had better, not only from dedicated boba tea spots, but even from Jenni Pho.
448	There is so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to Rice and Company.
449	The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.
450	Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)
451	There was hardly any meat.
452	Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.
453	It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.
454	To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted.
455	Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.
456	All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.
457	I don't have to be an accountant to know I'm getting screwed!
458	I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.
459	My salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of Palm.
460	The food was terrible.
461	Awful service.
462	They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!
463	This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.
464	It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.
465	However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.
466	Never again will I be dining at this place!
467	AN HOUR... seriously?
468	A greasy, unhealthy meal.
469	Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.
470	The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.
471	Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.
472	When I opened the sandwich, I was impressed, but not in a good way.
473	We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.
474	This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.
475	The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
476	Maybe if they weren't cold they would have been somewhat edible.
477	The desserts were a bit strange.
478	Very bad Experience!
479	I never come again.
480	If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.
481	Once your food arrives it's meh.
482	I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.
483	At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.
484	We won't be returning.
485	Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.
486	It was either too cold, not enough flavor or just bad.
487	Sauce was tasteless.
488	So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.
489	I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.
490	Unfortunately, it was not good.
491	After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.
492	!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!
493	Crust is not good.
494	Food was average at best.
495	It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.
496	I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.
497	He was terrible!
498	My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.
499	Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.
500	The chefs were friendly and did a good job.
501	The waitresses are very friendly.
502	The Macarons here are insanely good.
503	Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.
504	Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.
505	I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!
506	Owner's are really great people.!
507	Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.
508	Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!
509	Phenomenal food, service and ambiance.
510	Reasonably priced also!
511	I really enjoyed Crema Café before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast.
512	Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.
513	"That just SCREAMS ""LEGIT"" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas."
514	Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.
515	The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.
516	Awesome selection of beer.
517	I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.
518	will definitely be back!
519	Their daily specials are always a hit with my group.
520	definitely will come back here again.
521	The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.
522	This place is hands-down one of the best places to eat in the Phoenix metro area.
523	The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.
524	The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!
525	The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!
526	Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.
527	Fantastic food!
528	Come hungry, leave happy and stuffed!
529	Good value, great food, great service.
530	Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.
531	A great touch.
532	Overall, I like there food and the service.
533	When I'm on this side of town, this will definitely be a spot I'll hit up again!
534	It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.
535	OMG, the food was delicioso!
536	Overall, I like this place a lot.
537	If you haven't gone here GO NOW!
538	Those burgers were amazing.
539	The inside is really quite nice and very clean.
540	One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.
541	I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).
542	Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even.
543	This is a good joint.
544	Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.
545	Try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy, friendly service.
546	Just spicy enough.. Perfect actually.
547	The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.
548	Both great!
549	I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.
550	The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.
551	I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.
552	I always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner, which has a wide array of options to choose from.
553	This is a great restaurant at the Mandalay Bay.
554	In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome.
555	Great pork sandwich.

557	The block was amazing.
558	2 Thumbs Up!!
559	I promise they won't disappoint.
560	- the food is rich so order accordingly.
561	I LOVED it!
562	Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day.
563	Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.
564	This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.
565	My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.
566	My first visit to Hiro was a delight!
567	My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.
