1888	0	a	"The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an ""Are you being helped?"""
1982	0	a	I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
476	1	a	Better than you'd expect.
1924	0	a	TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.
426	1	a	Great Value.

1000	0	a	Nothing new there.  
1687	0	a	Just don't know why they were so slow.
2316	1	a	I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.

1703	0	a	I've had better bagels from the grocery store.
282	0	a	This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.
1204	1	a	This is high adventure at its best.  
1669	0	a	For service, I give them no stars.
562	1	a	Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.
1563	1	a	I don't think you will be disappointed.  
1318	1	a	But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  
1137	0	a	The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  
1615	0	a	If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.
1018	0	a	Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  
1879	0	a	I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.
570	1	a	Excellent Phone.

1066	0	a	Why was this film made?  
40	0	a	Pretty piece of junk.
837	0	a	One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.

1447	1	a	It's a sad movie, but very good.  
412	1	a	Plan on ordering from them again and again.
1344	1	a	Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  
1414	1	a	""" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  "

595	1	a	So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.
828	0	a	IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  
1637	0	a	I don't recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving.
114	0	a	You get what you pay for I guess.

1885	0	a	Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.
1959	0	a	I consider this theft.
1623	0	a	I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.
1400	1	a	Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  
243	0	a	The cable looks so thin and flimsy, it is scary.
1163	0	a	Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.

2223	1	a	A good time!
1462	1	a	The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  
1037	0	a	Very little music or anything to speak of.  
1026	0	a	Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  
519	1	a	It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.
1955	0	a	And the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasn't very tasty to me.
295	0	a	useless phone, simply deaf.
2276	1	a	So they performed.
2092	1	a	This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.
549	1	a	The screen size is big, key pad lit well enough, and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone.
400	1	a	The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.
739	1	a	Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!
505	1	a	I have purchased these for both family and friends, and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use
1829	0	a	Which are small and not worth the price.
930	0	a	Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  
1326	1	a	This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  
2260	1	a	Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!
2007	1	a	The guys all had steaks, and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak he's ever eaten.
798	1	a	So far it has worked like a charm.
267	0	a	I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.
922	0	a	About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  
759	1	a	I'm still infatuated with this phone.
1918	0	a	I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.
1570	1	a	There are some generally great things in it.  
898	0	a	I literally vomited while watching this film.  
1936	0	a	Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.
1592	1	a	The rest of the cast also play well.  
3	0	a	Product is useless, since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.
1839	0	a	Probably not in a hurry to go back.
1862	0	a	REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.
849	0	a	The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  
1958	0	a	I dressed up to be treated so rudely!
2049	1	a	I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza.
569	1	a	Great for the jawbone.
1733	0	a	The service here leaves a lot to be desired.
1709	0	a	I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.
1644	0	a	My husband said she was very rude... did not even apologize for the bad food or anything.
705	1	a	EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.
407	1	a	Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended
939	0	a	This is one I did not have, but I watched it recently on Fox Movie Channel, and was very disappointed.  
93	0	a	It was a waste of my money.
2294	1	a	The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.
246	0	a	The volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown.
1893	0	a	Don't do it!!!!
1525	1	a	It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  
213	0	a	The item received was Counterfeit.
553	1	a	It is light, easy to use, and has very clear reception and transmission.
1949	0	a	If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?
861	0	a	Even the squibs look awful.  
167	0	a	While I managed to bend the leaf spring back in place, the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop.
1848	0	a	This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.
1960	0	a	I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.
911	0	a	The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  
1962	0	a	Don't waste your time here.
1038	0	a	The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  
910	0	a	In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  
2128	1	a	Delicious and I will absolutely be back!
788	1	a	Worked perfectly!
462	1	a	IT'S REALLY EASY.
1947	0	a	I probably would not go here again.
999	0	a	I thought it was bad.  
970	0	a	There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  
503	1	a	The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.
482	1	a	This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.
2199	1	a	Nargile - I think you are great.
1992	0	a	Very disappointing!!!
1083	0	a	The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  
806	0	a	Again, lame.  
484	1	a	The best phone in market :).
2244	1	a	This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant.
2207	1	a	All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.
2331	1	a	And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.
748	1	a	Works great!.
963	0	a	This one just fails to create any real suspense.  
383	0	a	Poor quality.
1104	0	a	Really bad.  
830	0	a	Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  
1784	0	a	Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.
1488	1	a	The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  
762	1	a	Keep up the good work Amazon!!
1405	1	a	I liked this movie way too much.  
176	0	a	stay away from this store, be careful.
804	0	a	Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  
82	0	a	This pair of headphones is the worst that I have ever had sound-wise.
2157	1	a	I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.
2218	1	a	Cant say enough good things about this place.
319	0	a	The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.
716	1	a	Awsome Device Works Great!!.
1314	1	a	As a European, the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980's and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities, although the circumstances were slightly different.  
2318	1	a	An absolute must visit!
636	1	a	good item, low price.
2205	1	a	They were golden-crispy and delicious.
1868	0	a	I'm probably one of the few people to ever go to Ians and not like it.
1298	1	a	It was so funny.  
1176	0	a	It was just too horrible.  
2178	1	a	The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries, lawyers, and court staff.
212	0	a	I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.
1810	0	a	My husband and I ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service.
2086	1	a	Sooooo good!!
450	1	a	Love This Phone.
1208	1	a	The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  
997	0	a	It is shameful.  
1098	0	a	In short - this was a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to EVER see this film.  
492	1	a	Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.
2074	1	a	The restaurant atmosphere was exquisite.
1427	1	a	Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  
956	0	a	How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  
1312	1	a	PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  
1011	0	a	You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  
577	1	a	This is a great little item.
1867	0	a	My girlfriend's veal was very bad.
784	1	a	They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.
689	1	a	Made very sturdy.
344	0	a	Don't trust their website and don't expect any helpful support.
1980	0	a	The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.
1305	1	a	I especially liked the non-cliche choices with the parents; in other movies, I could predict the dialog verbatim, but the writing in this movie made better selections.  
1349	1	a	It's a gloriously fun, fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver.  
1067	0	a	Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  
1686	0	a	Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.
78	0	a	Poorly contstruct hinge.
2211	1	a	In an interesting part of town, this place is amazing.
994	0	a	The lead man is charisma-free.  
1432	1	a	Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  
1111	0	a	But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  
2063	1	a	So absolutley fantastic.
714	1	a	The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.
1079	0	a	The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  
1763	0	a	It was equally awful.
2059	1	a	this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.
962	0	a	His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  
1569	1	a	Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  
268	0	a	VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.
654	1	a	I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!
2377	1	a	He deserves 5 stars.
1589	1	a	I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  
1448	1	a	If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  
1977	0	a	For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
2220	1	a	Their steaks are 100% recommended!
415	1	a	Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.
2342	1	a	The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.
1861	0	a	The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.
2327	1	a	The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!
1272	1	a	The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  
1376	1	a	This movie is also revealing.  
233	0	a	NOT WHAT I WANTED.
698	1	a	It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.
2052	1	a	It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!
1725	0	a	I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.
1793	0	a	"not even a ""hello, we will be right with you."""
889	0	a	A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  
2189	1	a	Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.
1996	0	a	"I don't know what the big deal is about this place, but I won't be back ""ya'all""."
1316	1	a	It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  
1690	0	a	The selection of food was not the best.
514	1	a	Works good.
1113	0	a	If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  
872	0	a	I was very disappointed in the movie.  
2198	1	a	The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.
1820	0	a	I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.
602	1	a	much better than the hard plastic cases.
2361	1	a	We had a group of 70+ when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully.
2204	1	a	I had heard good things about this place, but it exceeding every hope I could have dreamed of.
1350	1	a	This is an extraordinary film.  
532	1	a	I'm pleased.
68	0	a	I'm a bit disappointed.
2083	1	a	We'd definitely go back here again.
2291	1	a	Great place to eat, reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the San Francisco Bay Area.
897	0	a	Everything about this movie is stupid.  
1657	0	a	She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.
1287	1	a	Excellent cast, story line, performances.  
95	0	a	Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.
1393	1	a	This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  
2289	1	a	The burger is good beef, cooked just right.
521	1	a	It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.
502	1	a	I love this phone , It is very handy and has a lot of features .
682	1	a	Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.
2151	1	a	Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.
860	0	a	Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  
1597	1	a	I rather enjoyed it.  
1082	0	a	Dee Snider just plain sucks.  
208	0	a	Saggy, floppy piece of junk.
1767	0	a	Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!
2046	1	a	The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.
1196	0	a	The soundtrack sucked.  
853	0	a	It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  
2076	1	a	Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!
1464	1	a	Raw and sublimely moving.  
261	0	a	I would have given no star if I was able.
2242	1	a	A great way to finish a great.
2056	1	a	They were excellent.
1777	0	a	Waiter was a jerk.
2252	1	a	The food, amazing.

976	0	a	I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  
887	0	a	I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  
97	0	a	Does not fit.
2047	1	a	I got to enjoy the seafood salad, with a fabulous vinegrette.
323	0	a	When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.
2134	1	a	Very good, though!
1336	1	a	I will never forget it now.  
1972	0	a	WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.
209	0	a	wont work right or atleast for me.
675	1	a	Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time, if not for an entire day.
733	1	a	Works for me.
1528	1	a	You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  
1379	1	a	This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  
1184	0	a	Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  
374	0	a	My only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5(of 5)
531	1	a	This is a great deal.
1494	1	a	The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  
393	0	a	Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.
2221	1	a	Awesome service and food.
1750	0	a	Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.

1512	1	a	Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  
411	1	a	Definitely a bargain.

1359	1	a	10 out of 10 stars.  
467	1	a	Those phones are working just fine now.
1234	1	a	The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.

134	0	a	It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.
1130	0	a	The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  
1497	1	a	It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  
1168	0	a	This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.

1222	1	a	(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.

1684	0	a	I will not be eating there again.
2044	1	a	My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.
668	1	a	Excellent product for the price.
1439	1	a	I really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies, and that they will continue to do so in their own, some kinda weird style.  
972	0	a	Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  
1433	1	a	This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  
780	1	a	That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.
928	0	a	Too politically correct.  
792	1	a	I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear, rather than inside.

2314	1	a	They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.
1640	0	a	When my order arrived, one of the gyros was missing.
1443	1	a	Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  
1859	0	a	I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services.
1152	0	a	Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  
1738	0	a	Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?
908	0	a	This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  
413	1	a	For the price this was a great deal.
1297	1	a	I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.

1759	0	a	This place deserves no stars.
712	1	a	Excellent bluetooth headset.
1722	0	a	Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil.
1188	0	a	The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  
2365	1	a	To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.
2022	1	a	For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.
1260	1	a	There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).

1258	1	a	) What makes this story different are the terrific production values - faultless photography, composition and editing - the terrific casting - the underappreciated Brian Keith playing a bully Teddy - and vivid history.

418	1	a	Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.
10	0	a	Basically the service was very bad.
1588	1	a	I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  
1586	1	a	Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  
1645	0	a	Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.
2154	1	a	The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.
245	0	a	Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.
183	0	a	You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.

2203	1	a	It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.
1323	1	a	While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  
1981	0	a	Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!
844	0	a	A truly, truly bad film.  
2378	1	a	Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!
1550	1	a	Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  
440	1	a	The battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago.
1293	1	a	I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  
1842	0	a	The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
1329	1	a	This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  
819	0	a	NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  
90	0	a	I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.

1327	1	a	It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).

1818	0	a	The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.
541	1	a	WELL IM SATISFIED.
2239	1	a	The pancake was also really good and pretty large at that.
842	0	a	Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  
1133	0	a	Seriously, it's not worth wasting your, or your kid's time on.  
539	1	a	Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.
1517	1	a	All things considered, a job very well done.

1647	0	a	But then they came back cold.
859	0	a	) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  
1159	0	a	All this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes.  
1523	1	a	The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  
823	0	a	This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  
1311	1	a	I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.

429	1	a	Excellent!.
1051	0	a	A cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation, lots of underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat in A Better Tomorrow) and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la John Woo.

2297	1	a	Penne vodka excellent!
900	0	a	If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  
147	0	a	It was horrible!.
1002	0	a	In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  
560	1	a	Great it was new packaged nice works good, no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!
196	0	a	The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.
291	0	a	Design Flaw?.
145	0	a	So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it.
1915	0	a	I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.
1409	1	a	Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  
1352	1	a	An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  
73	0	a	dont buy it.
2208	1	a	Ample portions and good prices.
276	0	a	The replacement died in a few weeks.
1057	0	a	None of them are engaging or exciting.  
1246	1	a	The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  
707	1	a	I am very happy
2319	1	a	Very friendly staff.
894	0	a	I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  
2095	1	a	I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.
1330	1	a	Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  
2137	1	a	I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.
1788	0	a	I got home to see the driest damn wings ever!
871	0	a	It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  
343	0	a	it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.
2102	1	a	I can't wait to go back.
1388	1	a	I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  
1218	1	a	Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  
537	1	a	I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.
653	1	a	Because both ears are occupied, background is not distracting at all.
263	0	a	However I needed some better instructions.
783	1	a	Crisp and Clear.
1850	0	a	The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!
99	0	a	However, the keypads are so tinny that I sometimes reach the wrong buttons.
1753	0	a	Do not waste your money here!
969	0	a	One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  
332	0	a	Worst ever.
809	0	a	At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  
2152	1	a	The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.
50	0	a	Poor Construction.
1418	1	a	And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  
2286	1	a	Definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly, will return next time I'm in Vegas.
498	1	a	I would recommend purchasing the Jabra JX-10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my Moto Q, go figure.
454	1	a	Very good stuff for the price.
118	0	a	All in all, I'd expected a better consumer experience from Motorola.
105	0	a	I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.
310	0	a	It was an inexpensive piece, but I would still have expected better quality.
551	1	a	This battery is an excellent bargain!
695	1	a	I searched the Internet, and found this one to be the best value.
1339	1	a	The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  
680	1	a	Great phone.
834	0	a	There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  
1780	0	a	Then our food came out, disappointment ensued.
927	0	a	And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  
9	0	a	Very disappointed in AccessoryOne.
2075	1	a	Give it a try, you will be happy you did.
491	1	a	Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.
238	0	a	They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.
1672	0	a	Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).
296	0	a	Battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor V3i.
1474	1	a	The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  
857	0	a	Now this is a movie I really dislike.  
64	0	a	If I take a picture, the battery drops a bar, and starts beeping, letting me know its dieing.
533	1	a	I really like this product over the Motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic.
508	1	a	And the sound quality is great.
1485	1	a	The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  
1224	1	a	Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  
1065	0	a	The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  
171	0	a	DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS
63	0	a	the phone was unusable and was not new.
869	0	a	The story is beyond stupid.  
5	0	a	Worst customer service.
1846	0	a	I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.
725	1	a	The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.
207	0	a	The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.
634	1	a	The case is great and works fine with the 680.
1897	0	a	i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?
1461	1	a	The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  
360	0	a	Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.
1043	0	a	But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  
1248	1	a	Totally different, with loads of understatement and black comedy, this is a film few get to see, but those who do will remember it.  
2263	1	a	Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!
427	1	a	It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.
2363	1	a	They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.
929	0	a	I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but this?  
1039	0	a	Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  
1269	1	a	All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  
1607	0	a	I think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking.
731	1	a	It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.
2066	1	a	I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.
1141	0	a	Omit watching this.  
1136	0	a	Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  
1683	0	a	The cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked.
2089	1	a	This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.
1543	1	a	The music in the film is really nice too.  
370	0	a	If you hate earbugs, avoid this phone by all means.
692	1	a	I love this phone!.
951	0	a	He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  
1968	0	a	Food was below average.
2176	1	a	Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.
907	0	a	I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  
1914	0	a	Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.
2308	1	a	You get incredibly fresh fish, prepared with care.
1306	1	a	Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  
2274	1	a	The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.
1319	1	a	A great film by a great director.  
166	0	a	One thing I hate is the mode set button at the side.
752	1	a	cool phone.
1003	0	a	But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  
1941	0	a	The real disappointment was our waiter.
2354	1	a	Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.
1295	1	a	You won't forget this movie!  
406	1	a	Razr Battery - Good buy.
1149	0	a	As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  
818	0	a	"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".  "
1953	0	a	The ripped banana was not only ripped, but petrified and tasteless.
2	0	a	Waste of 13 bucks.
1175	0	a	Characters are one-dimensional, even the good guys and especially the bad guys.  
1328	1	a	Conclusion - I loved it.  
1659	0	a	I've never been treated so bad.
2371	1	a	This place is amazing!
918	0	a	Avoid at ALL costs!  
1772	0	a	seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.
146	0	a	Bad Purchase.
625	1	a	I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.
1799	0	a	I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.
2304	1	a	I like Steiners because it's dark and it feels like a bar.
2290	1	a	The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.
357	0	a	REALLY UGLY.
1573	1	a	"It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  "
1882	0	a	We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.
487	1	a	It definitely was not as good as my S11.
1117	0	a	This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  
2061	1	a	And the chef was generous with his time (even came around twice so we can take pictures with him).
2036	1	a	Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.
852	0	a	The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  
2170	1	a	The food is very good for your typical bar food.
232	0	a	It lasts less than 3o minutes, if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.
903	0	a	But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  
1420	1	a	I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  
376	0	a	Buy a different phone - but not this.
1460	1	a	As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  
54	0	a	Excellent starter wireless headset.
925	0	a	There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  
516	1	a	I really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice, elegant and cool.
107	0	a	Not enough volume.
85	0	a	It doesn't make you look cool.
247	0	a	Even in my BMW 3 series which is fairly quiet, I have trouble hearing what the other person is saying.
2255	1	a	There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.
1541	1	a	Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  
1682	0	a	As a sushi lover avoid this place by all means.
2357	1	a	Generous portions and great taste.
2153	1	a	Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.
989	0	a	Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  
1946	0	a	The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.
808	0	a	But the premise of the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the U.S.  
80	0	a	Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.
2113	1	a	The vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole (choux) pastry was fresh enough.
1124	0	a	This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  
435	1	a	This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.
517	1	a	I got it because it was so small and adorable.
1056	0	a	Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  
2399	1	a	Service was good and the company was better!
626	1	a	Good case!.
799	1	a	Nice headset priced right.
2101	1	a	Good beer & drink selection and good food selection.
2118	1	a	the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.
773	1	a	I love this bluetooth!
708	1	a	This is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving.
311	0	a	Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.
490	1	a	The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.
92	0	a	After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.
1600	0	a	Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!
995	0	a	Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it.  
669	1	a	:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.
154	0	a	The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.
1970	0	a	Con: spotty service.
765	1	a	very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.
1761	0	a	Worst food/service I've had in a while.
2180	1	a	If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place.
124	0	a	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.
934	0	a	Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  
730	1	a	We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.
1595	1	a	Lange had become a great actress.  
1135	0	a	Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  
1396	1	a	And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  
1095	0	a	With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  
356	0	a	Don't buy it.
1145	0	a	To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  
23	0	a	We have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months.. Pros
1361	1	a	This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  
1552	1	a	Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  
892	0	a	You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  
1783	0	a	Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.
1428	1	a	In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  
1746	0	a	My brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day, and guess what he was sick all night too.
2321	1	a	Last night was my second time dining here and I was so happy I decided to go back!
1890	0	a	Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.
1557	1	a	His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  
227	0	a	Warning - Stay away.
178	0	a	sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.
606	1	a	Restored my phone to like new performance.
328	0	a	The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.
15	0	a	Don't make the same mistake I did.
571	1	a	WORTHWHILE.
1935	0	a	Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.
959	0	a	The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  
649	1	a	Great audio!.
1099	0	a	Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  
1480	1	a	Everything about this film is simply incredible.  
2145	1	a	They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.
22	0	a	I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.
103	0	a	Lousy product.
438	1	a	Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.
764	1	a	but it is great, i would really recommend it
43	0	a	This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.
1205	1	a	Okay, I like to consider myself a fair critic, so I'll give credit where credit's due--the creature effects were actually pretty cool.  
1274	1	a	Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  
1364	1	a	This movie has a cutting edge to it.  
156	0	a	Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens, which come in a three-pack.
540	1	a	I would highly recommend this product.
116	0	a	It's not what it says it is.
1973	0	a	(It wasn't busy either) Also, the building was FREEZING cold.
1166	0	a	""" But ""Storm Trooper"" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  "
1834	0	a	We aren't ones to make a scene at restaurants but I just don't get it...definitely lost the love after this one!
86	0	a	Bought mainly for the charger, which broke soon after purchasing.
2193	1	a	This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not disappoint.
2164	1	a	The sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as I have had.
2003	1	a	Server did a great job handling our large rowdy table.
1313	1	a	Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  
217	0	a	VERY DISAPPOINTED.
434	1	a	I received it quickly and it works great!!
1132	0	a	"Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie ""Grim"", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  "
655	1	a	Will order from them again!
1511	1	a	A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  
1084	0	a	There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  
840	0	a	There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  
2070	1	a	That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.
1726	0	a	But now I was completely grossed out.
1871	0	a	WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.
143	0	a	The battery is completely useless to me.
329	0	a	You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.
2287	1	a	They really want to make your experience a good one.
2295	1	a	Best tater tots in the southwest.
1749	0	a	Probably never coming back, and wouldn't recommend it.
767	1	a	Gets the job done.
766	1	a	Sound quality on both end is excellent, I use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me !2.
1236	1	a	I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  
2016	1	a	So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.
1997	0	a	But I definitely would not eat here again.
1455	1	a	The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  
2248	1	a	We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!
909	0	a	In a word, it is embarrassing.  
1450	1	a	This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  
589	1	a	Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.
1035	0	a	So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  
79	0	a	Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!
410	1	a	After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.
1979	0	a	The ambiance isn't much better.
950	0	a	I never walked out of a movie faster.  
432	1	a	This item is fantastic and works perfectly!
1441	1	a	Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  
561	1	a	I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!
1012	0	a	Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  
1540	1	a	If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  
98	0	a	I'll be looking for a new earpiece.
369	0	a	Disappointed!.
1985	0	a	After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.
34	0	a	Plus, I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.
586	1	a	You won't regret it!
1990	0	a	And the drinks are WEAK, people!
1291	1	a	There still are good actors around!  
1434	1	a	The aerial scenes were well-done.  
1186	0	a	It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  
528	1	a	I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.
1677	0	a	I can take a little bad service but the food sucks.
1123	0	a	I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  
362	0	a	How can that be?The audio quality is poor.
19	0	a	What a waste of time!
1173	0	a	The script is a big flawed mess.  
1411	1	a	Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  
60	0	a	Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!!
1209	1	a	Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  
1909	0	a	Spend your money and time some place else.
2110	1	a	When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.
826	0	a	Bela Lugosi was totally extraneous, intoning odd lines.  
1998	0	a	It really is impressive that the place hasn't closed down.
1835	0	a	Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.
1658	0	a	We won't be going back anytime soon!
405	1	a	Superb Phone on a Great Network.
111	0	a	Disapointing Results.
1806	0	a	I waited and waited.
1221	1	a	Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!

448	1	a	The reception through this headset is excellent.
285	0	a	bad fit, way too big.
4	0	a	None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.

785	1	a	The battery works great!
1562	1	a	But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  
1267	1	a	I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.

2033	1	a	Service is friendly and inviting.
286	0	a	Bluetooth does not work, phone locks up, screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.
1191	0	a	This show is made for Americans - it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere.

1898	0	a	I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.
1421	1	a	I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  
1445	1	a	Meredith M was better than all right.  
465	1	a	Great Pocket PC / phone combination.
1529	1	a	The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  
1481	1	a	I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  
2096	1	a	Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.
1837	0	a	For about 10 minutes, we we're waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasn't coming any time soon.
1044	0	a	Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  
822	0	a	Regrettably, the film fails.

2072	1	a	Good prices.

1284	1	a	Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  
709	1	a	It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.
1864	0	a	Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.
1833	0	a	After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.

2374	1	a	The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!
1109	0	a	Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  
1050	0	a	Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.

1978	0	a	So don't go there if you are looking for good food...

1220	1	a	It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  
599	1	a	Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range.
1500	1	a	"People who like European films and ""art movies"" will like this movie.  "
867	0	a	How awful she is!  
1705	0	a	The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
249	0	a	Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures, none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set, wiping out all my data.
2029	1	a	Great atmosphere, friendly and fast service.
2183	1	a	This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.
1106	0	a	This is probably the most irritating show I have ever seen in my entire life.  
1484	1	a	""" I love it.  "
958	0	a	Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  
803	0	a	Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  
2002	1	a	Special thanks to Dylan T. for the recommendation on what to order :) All yummy for my tummy.
1182	0	a	Camerawork - again, bad.  
713	1	a	All in all I think it was a good investment.
1730	0	a	The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.
580	1	a	Great sound and service.
1062	0	a	You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  
423	1	a	i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.
703	1	a	My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.
1187	0	a	There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  
1887	0	a	The food was barely lukewarm, so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us.
46	0	a	If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.
1993	0	a	The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
988	0	a	Even when the women finally show up, there is no sign of improvement; the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over, you might be far asleep.  
530	1	a	This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems
1089	0	a	Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  
1041	0	a	I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  
392	0	a	There was so much hype over this phone that I assumed it was the best, my mistake.
349	0	a	However, BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.
1622	0	a	Won't go back.
1144	0	a	It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  
1694	0	a	2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !
371	0	a	Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.
1516	1	a	I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  
1199	0	a	Everything stinks.  
83	0	a	Att is not clear, sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk.
127	0	a	The BT headset was such a disapoinment.
18	0	a	Doesn't hold charge.
1366	1	a	***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  
1105	0	a	Not easy to watch.  
1300	1	a	This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  
1711	0	a	I can't tell you how disappointed I was.
1808	0	a	This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.
364	0	a	Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.
1161	0	a	Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  
1299	1	a	If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  
2247	1	a	This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.
177	0	a	It's A PIECE OF CRAP!
2126	1	a	I did not expect this to be so good!
239	0	a	This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.
1060	0	a	Lots of holes in the script.  
1230	1	a	The camera really likes her in this movie.  
430	1	a	I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.
644	1	a	This case seems well made.
579	1	a	Small, sleek, impressive looking, practical setup with ample storage in place.
1635	0	a	Horrible - don't waste your time and money.
2078	1	a	Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.
2278	1	a	Best tacos in town by far!!
162	0	a	Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.
2235	1	a	We were promptly greeted and seated.
2351	1	a	We loved the place.
1172	0	a	Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  
2161	1	a	I can say that the desserts were yummy.
779	1	a	"The ""1.2"" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7."
1147	0	a	The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  
1800	0	a	Won't ever go here again.
382	0	a	Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.
1519	1	a	The point is the journey, a journey that touches every member of the family.  
1606	0	a	The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.
856	0	a	The only thing worse than Taylor's acting was Stanwyck's singing.  
967	0	a	Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  
646	1	a	The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.
2328	1	a	As always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious!
1285	1	a	The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  
340	0	a	The phone gets EXTREMELY HOT!
1322	1	a	Brilliant!  
1999	0	a	The turkey and roast beef were bland.
2027	1	a	Everything was good and tasty!
2391	1	a	They have great dinners.
1243	1	a	But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  
1708	0	a	I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.
1613	0	a	Crostini that came with the salad was stale.
0	0	a	Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.
1307	1	a	I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  
165	0	a	All three broke within two months of use.
1430	1	a	It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  
2042	1	a	(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)
485	1	a	Five star Plus, plus.
1650	0	a	Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.
2035	1	a	On the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.
1032	0	a	1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  
1140	0	a	I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  
2182	1	a	I'd love to go back.
1215	1	a	I rate this movie 9/10.  
168	0	a	The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.
1923	0	a	Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.
218	0	a	Kind of flops around.
1580	1	a	Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  
1548	1	a	Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  
214	0	a	This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it
1667	0	a	Hell no will I go back
1139	0	a	Long, whiny and pointless.  
558	1	a	Great phone.
1403	1	a	An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  
1377	1	a	Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  
1010	0	a	On the negative, it's insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen.  
952	0	a	By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  
550	1	a	I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.
388	0	a	It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.
1855	0	a	The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.
495	1	a	every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it.
743	1	a	O my gosh the best phone I have ever had.
258	0	a	The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.
1371	1	a	Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  
122	0	a	After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.
647	1	a	I highly recommend this case.
545	1	a	Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.
1475	1	a	Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  
1345	1	a	I have recommended it to friends.  
137	0	a	Horrible, horrible protector.
741	1	a	Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.
469	1	a	Clear crisp sound.
265	0	a	After 3 months, screen just went black all of a sudden.
817	0	a	The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  
2349	1	a	I had strawberry tea, which was good.
1823	0	a	the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.
1368	1	a	This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films.  
281	0	a	First of all, it doesn't wear well.
1653	0	a	We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.
2224	1	a	I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.
1197	0	a	"This was a poor remake of ""My Best Friends Wedding"".  "
2129	1	a	DELICIOUS!!
1633	0	a	I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!
1116	0	a	I paid too much.  
1747	0	a	The potato chip order was sad... I could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12.
1201	1	a	Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  
1391	1	a	It was also the right balance of war and love.  
1900	0	a	This place lacked style!!
182	0	a	Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!
1743	0	a	I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.
827	0	a	& That movie was bad.  
322	0	a	I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.
1702	0	a	Friend's pasta -- also bad, he barely touched it.
331	0	a	WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.
222	0	a	I've bought $5 wired headphones that sound better than these.
1905	0	a	The refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland.
813	0	a	At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  
1342	1	a	This movie creates its own universe, and is fascinating in every way.  
1948	0	a	The RI style calamari was a joke.
2108	1	a	You cant go wrong with any of the food here.
57	0	a	The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.
1967	0	a	After two I felt disgusting.
1735	0	a	Perhaps I caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews, but I'm not inspired to go back.
1202	1	a	In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  
777	1	a	Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.
11	0	a	Bad Choice.
1760	0	a	On the ground, right next to our table was a large, smeared, been-stepped-in-and-tracked-everywhere pile of green bird poop.
501	1	a	It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.
20	0	a	I'm very disappointed with my decision.
1127	0	a	I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  
2347	1	a	This was my first crawfish experience, and it was delicious!
2123	1	a	Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!
1179	0	a	Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  
1568	1	a	It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  
294	0	a	My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.
2339	1	a	CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.
1454	1	a	This film offers many delights and surprises.  
1626	0	a	Would not go back.
202	0	a	Not worth it.
2121	1	a	The deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks, and Jeff went above and beyond what we expected.
1856	0	a	We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!
359	0	a	Having trouble with volume.
2200	1	a	Today is the second time I've been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good.
670	1	a	I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.
1609	0	a	Any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one.
1712	0	a	Weird vibe from owners.
985	0	a	At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  
1884	0	a	Don't bother coming here.
673	1	a	THey are so cool!
1210	1	a	The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  
1237	1	a	The writer, Gorman Bechard, undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character-age appropriate.  
1120	0	a	Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  
687	1	a	It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.
2011	1	a	Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.
2138	1	a	The only good thing was our waiter, he was very helpful and kept the bloddy mary's coming.
1849	0	a	Not good by any stretch of the imagination.
361	0	a	Buyer Beware, you could flush money right down the toilet.
1841	0	a	Waited and waited and waited.
1984	0	a	The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.
1813	0	a	We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.
1621	0	a	The food was terrible.
811	0	a	But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  
915	0	a	Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  
585	1	a	I have a Verizon LG phone and they work well together, good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight.
327	0	a	Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.
1331	1	a	"The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the ""acting coach"" are fascinating.  "
489	1	a	I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.
102	0	a	Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.
28	0	a	Very disappointing.
536	1	a	Exactly what I wanted.
1718	0	a	There is nothing authentic about this place.
428	1	a	Gets a signal when other Verizon phones won't.
1482	1	a	Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  
899	0	a	Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  
1013	0	a	The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  
769	1	a	This is a great phone!.
1664	0	a	By this point, my friends and I had basically figured out this place was a joke and didn't mind making it publicly and loudly known.
1006	0	a	He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  
2173	1	a	The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!
1670	0	a	The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.
833	0	a	Wasted two hours.  
250	0	a	We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement
816	0	a	It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  
2181	1	a	Food was really good and I got full petty fast.
612	1	a	I highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try.
1870	0	a	We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.
1090	0	a	Rating: 1 out of 10.  
500	1	a	I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.
845	0	a	The directing seems too pretentious.  
1710	0	a	We've tried to like this place but after 10+ times I think we're done with them.
2192	1	a	Very good food, great atmosphere.1
71	0	a	"The design is very odd, as the ear ""clip"" is not very comfortable at all."
527	1	a	Excellent product, I am very satisfied with the purchase.
2364	1	a	The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.
787	1	a	The tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate, etc.
2165	1	a	Seriously flavorful delights, folks.
483	1	a	This BlueAnt Supertooth hands-free phone speaker is AWESOME.
113	0	a	I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.
618	1	a	The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.
2130	1	a	I love this place.
1395	1	a	I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  
433	1	a	Great Earpiece.
1641	0	a	The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.
2326	1	a	Food was good, service was good, Prices were good.
308	0	a	A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!
346	0	a	I still maintain that monkeys shouldn't make headphones, we just obviously don't share enough DNA to copy the design over to humans.
1781	0	a	Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.
1092	0	a	He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  
1942	0	a	I was so insulted.
1473	1	a	I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  
315	0	a	Not good enough for the price.
1438	1	a	Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  
933	0	a	(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  
1608	0	a	We sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left.
1693	0	a	The place was not clean and the food oh so stale!
2282	1	a	They know how to make them here.
1782	0	a	Poor service, the waiter made me feel like I was stupid every time he came to the table.
140	0	a	I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.
1860	0	a	If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.
1275	1	a	Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  
2373	1	a	The portion was huge!
1356	1	a	I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  
1406	1	a	The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  
1007	0	a	Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  
2312	1	a	All of the tapas dishes were delicious!
2324	1	a	All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.
2362	1	a	Omelets are to die for!
1612	0	a	Please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles.
882	0	a	The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  
403	1	a	Works as described.
1266	1	a	At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  
1966	0	a	The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.
901	0	a	The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  
65	0	a	It's so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers, car chargers, cradles, headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out.
1762	0	a	We asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didn't bring that either.
1358	1	a	Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  
316	0	a	I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.
957	0	a	This is definitely one of the bad ones.  
776	1	a	It's a great item.
1565	1	a	Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  
1309	1	a	The film's dialogue is natural, real to life.  
1	0	a	THAT one didn't work either.
576	1	a	Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.
55	0	a	Performed awful -- muffled, tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.
2345	1	a	The fries were great too.
141	0	a	Piece of Junk.
662	1	a	Excellent sound quality.
807	0	a	Glad I didn't pay to see it.  
1756	0	a	Boy was that sucker dry!!.
1558	1	a	This is such a fun and funny movie.  
478	1	a	Good audio quality.
1844	0	a	I wouldn't return.
493	1	a	My headset works just peachy-keen.
548	1	a	This is an excellent tool, especially when paired with your phone's auto-answer.
1976	0	a	Overall I was not impressed and would not go back.
1963	0	a	Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star.
1446	1	a	I sat riveted to the TV screen.  
1251	1	a	The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  
552	1	a	I would recommend this.
936	0	a	The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  
2227	1	a	A couple of months later, I returned and had an amazing meal.
2090	1	a	My friend loved the salmon tartar.
1765	0	a	Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.
790	1	a	A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.

1627	0	a	Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.
44	0	a	Awkward to use and unreliable.

661	1	a	Love this headset!
1077	0	a	The script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed.  
2384	1	a	Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.
131	0	a	very disappointed.
2217	1	a	It was just not a fun experience.
1101	0	a	Everything about it is just bad.  
1457	1	a	A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  
1634	0	a	Your servers suck, wait, correction, our server Heimer sucked.
1353	1	a	They could be used as exemplars for any set designer.  
307	0	a	Low Quality.
1273	1	a	In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.

300	0	a	worthless product.
941	0	a	Highly unrecommended.  
1698	0	a	- They never brought a salad we asked for.
1961	0	a	Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.
16	0	a	Muddy, low quality sound, and the casing around the wire's insert was poorly super glued and slid off.
1957	0	a	Furthermore, you can't even find hours of operation on the website!
916	0	a	These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  
1255	1	a	The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  
1252	1	a	Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  
2333	1	a	I *heart* this place.
1087	0	a	But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  
1986	0	a	Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
1802	0	a	The service was poor and thats being nice.

772	1	a	Has been working great.
904	0	a	The film looks cheap and bland.  
1239	1	a	The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  
2268	1	a	I'll definitely be in soon again.
1074	0	a	If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  
1556	1	a	His performance is simply genius.  
1901	0	a	I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.
587	1	a	Its a total package.

1769	0	a	this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.
1581	1	a	All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  
1465	1	a	It has northern humour and positive about the community it represents.  
1603	0	a	Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.
896	0	a	Also the story and acting were weak.  
431	1	a	Great product for the price!.
1553	1	a	Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  
2270	1	a	This is an Outstanding little restaurant with some of the Best Food I have ever tasted.
841	0	a	Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  
1277	1	a	Great movie!  
1029	0	a	Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  
461	1	a	It seems completely secure, both holding on to my belt, and keeping the iPhone inside.
2103	1	a	Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.
2023	1	a	Oh this is such a thing of beauty, this restaurant.
1017	0	a	The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  
650	1	a	This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.
1801	0	a	The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.
1836	0	a	I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.
297	0	a	The battery life is highly unacceptable.
1151	0	a	Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  
697	1	a	I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.
2127	1	a	I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.
2309	1	a	These were so good we ordered them twice.
2064	1	a	The shrimp tender and moist.
1288	1	a	Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  
2386	1	a	The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.
949	0	a	There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  
1185	0	a	And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  
895	0	a	The concert sequences just sucked.  
29	0	a	I would not recommend this item to anyone.
1689	0	a	did not like at all.
2172	1	a	Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.
1189	0	a	Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  
1524	1	a	Simply beautiful.  
313	0	a	So just beware.
1247	1	a	How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  
529	1	a	It's very attractive and appears to be of good quality.
1912	0	a	the presentation of the food was awful.
1822	0	a	I came back today since they relocated and still not impressed.
385	0	a	Mic Doesn't work.
1463	1	a	It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  
1616	0	a	I live in the neighborhood so I am disappointed I won't be back here, because it is a convenient location.
2398	1	a	We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside.
1692	0	a	say bye bye to your tip lady!
1431	1	a	Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  
1591	1	a	He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  
1555	1	a	But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  
770	1	a	Protects the phone on all sides.
1926	0	a	I will not return.
2353	1	a	We walked away stuffed and happy about our first Vegas buffet experience.
738	1	a	The mic is great.
831	0	a	Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  
1324	1	a	The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  
704	1	a	It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.
720	1	a	This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.
1192	0	a	I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  
1476	1	a	The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  
2305	1	a	I had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!
345	0	a	I had to purchase a different case.
885	0	a	The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  
1402	1	a	They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  
1723	0	a	Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
847	0	a	Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  
1797	0	a	This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!
1585	1	a	I loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had it's share of ups and down, but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other.  
515	1	a	I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.
1828	0	a	There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.
1930	0	a	Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(
320	0	a	I was not happy with this item.
391	0	a	Obviously they have a terrible customer service, so you get what you pay for.
717	1	a	This little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier.
628	1	a	I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.
1332	1	a	John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  
2062	1	a	Highly recommended.
474	1	a	The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.
791	1	a	Excellent dual-purpose headset.
710	1	a	Just really good.. So far, probably the best BT headset I have ever had.
1025	0	a	He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  
836	0	a	The script is horrendously stupid.  
2058	1	a	Will be back again!
459	1	a	#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.
1886	0	a	Third, the cheese on my friend's burger was cold.
1241	1	a	Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  
2084	1	a	Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.
737	1	a	Great price, too!
2332	1	a	Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.
198	0	a	You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.
688	1	a	Good case, Excellent value.
439	1	a	Blue Ant is easy to use.
1590	1	a	I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  
1195	0	a	It was horrendous.  
607	1	a	Better Than New.
1444	1	a	I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  
873	0	a	The visual effects were AWFUL.  
797	1	a	These are fabulous!
2317	1	a	Great place fo take out or eat in.
499	1	a	Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.
2169	1	a	He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.
1374	1	a	This is an excellent film.  
992	0	a	That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  
968	0	a	The acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book, that's how bad it is.  
1278	1	a	It looked like a wonderful story.  
1200	1	a	It is an insane game.  
445	1	a	The bose noise cancelling is amazing, which is very important for a NYC commuter.
1375	1	a	When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  
1033	0	a	All in all, a great disappointment.  
1630	0	a	Total brunch fail.
1582	1	a	In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  
1115	0	a	This was a flick doomed from its conception.  
372	0	a	I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.
965	0	a	This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  
1487	1	a	STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  
848	0	a	Avoid at any and all costs.  
1030	0	a	The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.  
1874	0	a	My friend did not like his Bloody Mary.
1486	1	a	Definitely worth checking out.  
812	0	a	But she is still a bad actress, repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures.  
47	0	a	My father has the V265, and the battery is dying.
1877	0	a	Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.
520	1	a	I would highly recommend this.
142	0	a	The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever.
1156	0	a	The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  
264	0	a	I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.
1194	0	a	The movie seemed a little slow at first.  
1720	0	a	I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.
1906	0	a	The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.
1212	1	a	I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  
2185	1	a	I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.
2245	1	a	The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.
2285	1	a	We loved the biscuits!!!
1770	0	a	I probably won't be coming back here.
2258	1	a	Their chow mein is so good!
1131	0	a	About half way through this film I started to dislike it.  
2139	1	a	This place is two thumbs up....way up.
2379	1	a	This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.
1279	1	a	"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in ""At Play In The Fields Of The Lord"".  "
701	1	a	The color is even prettier than I thought it would be, and the graphics are incredibly sharp.
754	1	a	I've owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that it's the best mobile phone I've had.
638	1	a	I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.
2344	1	a	Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.
676	1	a	I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.
1397	1	a	The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  
1437	1	a	There is a brilliant twist ending.  
442	1	a	The phone is sturdy and waterproof.
32	0	a	Just does not work.
1560	1	a	This is actually a very smart movie.  
690	1	a	The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.
1656	0	a	I just wanted to leave.
1009	0	a	Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  
1169	0	a	The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  
572	1	a	Iam very pleased with my purchase.
1470	1	a	Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  
1499	1	a	An excellent performance from Ms.  
1472	1	a	10/10  
935	0	a	I wasn't the least bit interested.  
2122	1	a	Waitress was sweet and funny.
1333	1	a	It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  
1264	1	a	For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  
1302	1	a	I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  
1695	0	a	It was way over fried.
1408	1	a	The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  
721	1	a	This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.
1341	1	a	Definitely worth checking out.  
1786	0	a	Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.
870	0	a	The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  
851	0	a	I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  
700	1	a	great headset, very impressed - H500.
2162	1	a	Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.
187	0	a	No additional ear gels provided, and no instructions whatsoever.
1165	0	a	The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted.  
1308	1	a	Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  
2082	1	a	The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.
1598	1	a	I really liked that.  
2197	1	a	Four stars for the food & the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe & still letting us in to eat !
1282	1	a	The cast is good.  
880	0	a	Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  
1863	0	a	I swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed.
1118	0	a	If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  
1596	1	a	I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  
1845	0	a	Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.
1167	0	a	The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  
1059	0	a	Of course, the acting is blah.  
1404	1	a	The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  
865	0	a	This movie is BAD.  
1638	0	a	I won't try going back there even if it's empty.
1880	0	a	We won't be going back.
921	0	a	I couldn't take them seriously.  
1965	0	a	RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.
623	1	a	Fits comfortably, came with three sizes of earbud tips.
193	0	a	The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.
52	0	a	Could not get strong enough signal.
2307	1	a	Waitress was good though!
1680	0	a	Thoroughly disappointed!
138	0	a	Rip off---- Over charge shipping.
1731	0	a	The Burrittos Blah!
1649	0	a	-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.
1360	1	a	Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  
2171	1	a	This is an unbelievable BARGAIN!
1940	0	a	I won't be back.
306	0	a	If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone.
2212	1	a	I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.
155	0	a	The commercials are the most misleading.
129	0	a	What a piece of junk.. I lose more calls on this phone.
272	0	a	I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.
685	1	a	I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.
1036	0	a	This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  
2001	1	a	If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!
1847	0	a	It's too bad the food is so damn generic.
1866	0	a	We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.
1651	0	a	"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them."
1128	0	a	Today the graphics are crap.  
596	1	a	You'll love how thin it is.
1876	0	a	a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food, but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait.
441	1	a	I love this thing!
273	0	a	I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.
659	1	a	Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !
404	1	a	Works fine.
460	1	a	For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.
31	0	a	Not impressed.
1157	0	a	I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  
2313	1	a	In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.
761	1	a	Would recommend this item.
463	1	a	It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.
299	0	a	If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.
639	1	a	Nice Sound.
510	1	a	its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.
337	0	a	Very Displeased.
1121	0	a	I'm terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades, especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there.  
1281	1	a	Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  
179	0	a	Adapter does not provide enough charging current.
49	0	a	Defective crap.
1830	0	a	AVOID THIS ESTABLISHMENT!
398	0	a	The plug did not work very well.
2065	1	a	Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.
2079	1	a	My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.
805	0	a	It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  
2190	1	a	Good service, very clean, and inexpensive, to boot!
1337	1	a	A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  
367	0	a	Same problem as others have mentioned.
2014	1	a	The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.
664	1	a	I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).
1292	1	a	And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  
961	0	a	Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  
2031	1	a	Service is also cute.
280	0	a	However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.
2310	1	a	Service is quick and friendly.

236	0	a	I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.
727	1	a	I use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment, and it works great!
100	0	a	Unfortunately it did not work.
1034	0	a	The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  
215	0	a	First off the reception sucks, I have never had more than 2 bars, ever.
984	0	a	The least said about the acting the better.  
2097	1	a	Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!
1203	1	a	Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  
39	0	a	This is a simple little phone to use, but the breakage is unacceptible.
2288	1	a	Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!
1956	0	a	I could barely stomach the meal, but didn't complain because it was a business lunch.
1024	0	a	I hate movies like that.  
110	0	a	But when I check voice mail at night, the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message, and then I'm lost.
1078	0	a	What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  
2098	1	a	Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough!
13	0	a	horrible, had to switch 3 times.
144	0	a	The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.
317	0	a	Terrible product, and waste of money!

1764	0	a	After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!
1321	1	a	I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  
2233	1	a	Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.
251	0	a	My phone sounded OK ( not great - OK), but my wife's phone was almost totally unintelligible, she couldn't understand a word being said on it.
747	1	a	Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.
378	0	a	I don't like this Nokia either.
627	1	a	Great case and price!
368	0	a	This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.
455	1	a	I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.
1061	0	a	I'll even say it again  this is torture.  
2214	1	a	The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.
1545	1	a	The cast is always entertaining as usual.  
275	0	a	I only hear garbage for audio.

211	0	a	Audio Quality is poor, very poor.
1315	1	a	"It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing ""Turkey in the Straw"" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  "
868	0	a	It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  
656	1	a	Good transmit audio.
1206	1	a	If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  
2360	1	a	I had a seriously solid breakfast here.
394	0	a	The buttons for on and off are bad.
2025	1	a	I love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it.
621	1	a	Very prompt service.
504	1	a	The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.
2117	1	a	Service was very prompt.
1373	1	a	But I thought his acting was skilled.  
652	1	a	You can't beat the price on these.
975	0	a	Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  
1881	0	a	He was extremely rude and really, there are so many other restaurants I would love to dine at during a weekend in Vegas.
108	0	a	Buyer--Be Very Careful!!!!!.
588	1	a	A pretty good product.
1049	0	a	Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  
2167	1	a	The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.
255	0	a	The sound quality for the device is unacceptable.Unless you are in a really quiet area, you almost hear nothing.
862	0	a	The script iswas there a script?  
1904	0	a	Nothing special.
1380	1	a	This is the number one best TH game in the series.  
932	0	a	A bit predictable.  
1054	0	a	There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  
1489	1	a	Totally believable.  
1072	0	a	Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  
635	1	a	clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cent's up-and-coming.
1384	1	a	I gave it a 10  
466	1	a	It does everything the description said it would.
375	0	a	Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).
475	1	a	Works well.
1477	1	a	I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  
2077	1	a	After one bite, I was hooked.
609	1	a	Really good product.
1386	1	a	It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  
288	0	a	It didn't charge for me.
2229	1	a	Great food and awesome service!
1498	1	a	:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  
384	0	a	Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.
7	0	a	It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.
2166	1	a	If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.
2382	1	a	They also have the best cheese crisp in town.
1798	0	a	It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.
1599	1	a	It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  
254	0	a	The worst phone I've ever had.... Only had it for a few months.
507	1	a	T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.
2292	1	a	Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.
1268	1	a	Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  
1578	1	a	I just saw this film and I recommend it.  
2380	1	a	I was seated immediately.
1108	0	a	So bad.  
2107	1	a	Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.
414	1	a	I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.
605	1	a	Works great!.
401	1	a	I was very excited to get this headset because I thought it was really cute.
2080	1	a	Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing
1401	1	a	I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  
1417	1	a	The transfers are very good.  
497	1	a	Comfortable in my hand.
802	0	a	The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  
2018	1	a	Very convenient, since we were staying at the MGM!
2091	1	a	The yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh.
1891	0	a	The worst was the salmon sashimi.
1892	0	a	Would not recommend to others.
314	0	a	I cannot make calls at certain places.
452	1	a	Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.
509	1	a	Better than expected.
2323	1	a	The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.
672	1	a	)Setup couldn't have been simpler.
1819	0	a	Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.
1790	0	a	The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger.
1303	1	a	Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  
990	0	a	It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  
195	0	a	I found this product to be waaay too big.
955	0	a	THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  
1539	1	a	You wont regret it!  
2241	1	a	I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!
1605	0	a	The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.
2322	1	a	They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval.
973	0	a	It's a case of 'so bad it is laughable'.  
1276	1	a	However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  
1005	0	a	I had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief!  
1027	0	a	What the hell kind of crap is that?!  
1045	0	a	Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  
330	0	a	So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.
1424	1	a	It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  
2335	1	a	I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!
1425	1	a	The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  
1180	0	a	Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  
1510	1	a	And I really did find them funny.  
2226	1	a	Service was fantastic.
456	1	a	After charging overnight, these batteries work great.
1789	0	a	I would not recommend this place.
1625	0	a	The selection was probably the worst I've seen in Vegas.....there was none.
728	1	a	But, in any case, the best part is, you can download these pictures to your laptop using IR, or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone.
135	0	a	I ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately.
1551	1	a	The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  
84	0	a	i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.
1235	1	a	The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  
1256	1	a	I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  
1969	0	a	Very, very sad.
630	1	a	I connected my wife's bluetooth,(Motorola HS850) to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case.
1514	1	a	It is a true classic.  
2348	1	a	On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.
2081	1	a	The steak was amazing...rge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had!
1153	0	a	I've seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie.  
1508	1	a	A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  
2306	1	a	At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.
1894	0	a	It sure does beat the nachos at the movies but I would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant.
1520	1	a	This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  
2232	1	a	Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.
119	0	a	Sending it back.
2114	1	a	Great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting.
458	1	a	I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.
125	0	a	Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!
1542	1	a	I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  
2206	1	a	The wontons were thin, not thick and chewy, almost melt in your mouth.
1944	0	a	Service stinks here!
38	0	a	[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!
2146	1	a	An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.
1964	0	a	I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.
2043	1	a	By far the BEST cheesecurds we have ever had!
1742	0	a	It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.
1937	0	a	I have been in more than a few bars in Vegas, and do not ever recall being charged for tap water.
1452	1	a	He's a national treasure.  
2094	1	a	I love this place.
1734	0	a	This place is horrible and way overpriced.
151	0	a	Cant get the software to work with my computer.
2141	1	a	We enjoy their pizza and brunch.
62	0	a	Plug was the wrong size.
1995	0	a	They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.
1022	0	a	If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  
1910	0	a	I probably won't be back, to be honest.
1232	1	a	The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  
1547	1	a	Trumbull on I LOVE LUCY).  
542	1	a	This one works and was priced right.
2201	1	a	I would recommend saving room for this!
557	1	a	Price is good too.
544	1	a	Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.
1365	1	a	I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  
2219	1	a	The bartender was also nice.
303	0	a	if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.
755	1	a	Its the best headset I have used.
242	0	a	The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.
775	1	a	I would recommend it.
87	0	a	I put the latest OS on it (v1.15g), and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while.
1521	1	a	All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  
2359	1	a	Loved it...friendly servers, great food, wonderful and imaginative menu.
1354	1	a	Go rent it.  
1631	0	a	Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees.
998	0	a	It's a shame to see good actors like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess like this.  
1707	0	a	By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.
197	0	a	Uncomfortable In the Ear, Don't use with LG VX9900 (EnV).
289	0	a	Sprint - terrible customer service.
2254	1	a	I will be back many times soon.
902	0	a	The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  
1857	0	a	She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.
667	1	a	I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!
132	0	a	Earbud piece breaks easily.
2267	1	a	This isn't a small family restaurant, this is a fine dining establishment.
2210	1	a	The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.
1119	0	a	It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  
1666	0	a	I give it 2 thumbs down
522	1	a	Comfort for our whole family.
1286	1	a	This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  
354	0	a	Terrible phone holder.
1676	0	a	We also ordered the spinach and avocado salad; the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste.
1526	1	a	Excellent performance.  
1040	0	a	It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  
1536	1	a	""" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  "
2067	1	a	Dessert: Panna Cotta was amazing.
348	0	a	No buyers remorse on this one!.
186	0	a	It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).
740	1	a	Good , works fine.
1422	1	a	It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  
1340	1	a	It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  
1008	0	a	There were too many close ups.  
1674	0	a	This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.
1031	0	a	It's very slow.  
2394	1	a	I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.
53	0	a	I really wanted the Plantronics 510 to be the right one, but it has too many issues for me.The good
2266	1	a	Everyone is treated equally special.
1347	1	a	Waste your money on this game.  
1911	0	a	I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.
33	0	a	I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.
1933	0	a	Very poor service.
2393	1	a	Great brunch spot.
1440	1	a	It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.

1490	1	a	"This is a very ""right on case"" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  "
219	0	a	The pleather case doesn't fit.
881	0	a	It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  
1479	1	a	I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  
760	1	a	I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.
1138	0	a	It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  
290	0	a	People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.
1019	0	a	The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  
1362	1	a	But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  
1803	0	a	This place should honestly be blown up.
169	0	a	The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.
1399	1	a	Duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance.  
228	0	a	Very Dissapointing Performance.
